# Void Defender

Void Defender is a vertically scrolling space shooter created in Unity's 2D engine.

## How to Play

- Install the game using void_defender_setup.exe in the releases section. There will be an executable application file wherever you decide to install the game.
- Download the source code zip under Code. Unzip the folder into a location of your choosing. Now, open the Builds folder and select the most recent version. Finally, open the file named Void Defender and voila.

## Controls

Using a controller is the best experience for Void Defender. Keyboard+mouse controls are implemented, but they are awkward to use in my opinion. Optimizing controls is a goal of mine.

### Xbox Controller (Only fully verified controller so far)

- Start Button: Pauses the game.
- Left Analog Stick: Moves your character.
- Right Analog Stick: Aims your secondary weapon at the appropriate time.
- A Button: Confirms choices in menus.
- B Button: Cancels choices and/or exits when in menus. Cancels aiming of secondary weapon.
- Y Button: Switches main weapon.
- Right Trigger (RT): Fires your main weapon.
- Left Bumper (LB): First press enables aiming of secondary weapon. Second press fires the weapon.

### Keyboard+Mouse

- Escape: Pauses the game.
- WASD (or Arrows): Moves your character.
- Mouse: Aims your secondary weapon at the appropriate time.
