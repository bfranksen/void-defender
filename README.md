# Void Defender
Void Defender is a vertically scrolling space shooter created in Unity's 2D engine.

## How to Play
- Install the game using void_defender_setup.exe in the releases section. There will be an executable application file wherever you decide to install the game.
- Clone this repository (or download the source code zip under Code). In Unity, open the folder named Void Defender from within the source folder. Once everything is imported, just hit play.

## Controls
Using a controller is the best experience for Void Defender. Keyboard+mouse controls have some implementation, but I have not fully configured the setup yet. Hopefully k+m will be ready to go soon.

### Xbox Controller (Only fully verified controller so far)
- Left Analog Stick: Moves your character.
- Right Analog Stick: Aims your secondary weapon at the appropriate time.
- A Button: Confirms choices in menus.
- B Button: Cancels choices and/or exits when in menus. Cancels aiming of secondary weapon.
- Right Trigger (RT): Fires your main weapon.
- Left Bumper (LB): First press enables aiming of secondary weapon. Second press fires the weapon.
